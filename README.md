What this is
===

A set of scripts using webdriver and casper to do fun (and sometimes dangerous) things with a BigCommerce store. For instance, if you want to add dummy orders, customers etc for testing, the API end points don't let you do these...(for right reasons). However, just for fun, if we want to automate this...?

By the way, BigCommerce has nothing to do with this...Read the following license. In simple terms, if you use this code to do crazy stuff like delete orders, etc...nobody except you are responsible. :-). You know what, just use it wisely!

Licensing stuff - applies to all code in this repo
